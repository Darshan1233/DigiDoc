			Rajgad (literal meaning Ruling Fort) is a Hill region fort situated in the Pune district of Maharashtra, India. Formerly known as Murumdev, the fort was the first capital of the Maratha Empire under the rule of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj for almost 26 years, after which the capital was moved to the Raigad Fort.[1] Treasures discovered from an adjacent fort called Torna were used to completely build and fortify the Rajgad Fort.[citation needed]

			The Rajgad Fort is located around 60 km (37 mi) to the south-west of Pune and about 15 km (9.3 mi) west of Nasrapur in the Sahyadris range. The fort lies 1,376 m (4,514 ft) above the sea level. The diameter of the base of the fort was about 40 km (25 mi) which made it difficult to lay siege on it, which added to its strategic value. The fort's ruins consist of palaces, water cisterns, and caves. This fort was built on a hill called Murumbadevi Dongar (Mountain of the Goddess Murumba). Rajgad boasts of the highest number of days stayed by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj on any fort.

			History

			The fort has stood witness to many significant historic events including the birth of Chhatrapati Shivaji's son Rajaram I, the death of Chhatrapati Shivaji's wife Saibai, the return of Shivaji from Agra, the burial of Afzal Khan's head in the Mahadarwaja walls of Balle Killa, the strict words of Sonopant Dabir to Shivaji.[citation needed]

			The Rajgad Fort was also one of the 12 forts that Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj kept when he signed the Treaty of Purandar in 1665, with the Mughal general Jai Singh I, leader of the Mughal forces. Under this treaty, 23 forts were handed over to the Mughals.

			How to reach:
			
			By Air: The nearest airport to the fort is located in Pune at a distance of around 75 km. Once you have reached Pune, you can either hire a direct cab or use public transport to reach Pali, which is a small village at the base of the hills and it is the place from where one needs to trek up the hill. 
			
			By Rail: You can catch a direct train to Pune railway station and then from there, you can either hire a direct cab or public transport to reach Pali. The distance between Pune railway station and Pali village is 68 km. 

			By Road: The village of Pali is easily accessible by road. From the village, you need to trek up the hill to reach the fort.
